# Description

I have created a routes.js file to intialize my routes with functions in that, this is to seperate my routes from app.js.

From app.js passing the app(express) as parameter to the route, so that i can access the app from my route page.

I have controller folder, in that you can declare the functions based on the purpose.

You can create as much controllers you need. You need to specify the path in the route.js to use the new controller.
